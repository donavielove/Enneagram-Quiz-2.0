# Enneagram-Quiz-2.0

This project is an updated version of the original Enneagram Quiz Donavie Ordonez created.
Collaboration of Dennis Tye and Kenneth Doan were done through Bitbucket.

1.	Team Members and responsibilities of each:
- Donavie Ordonez - UI, enneagram quiz research, typeAnswers class and database connection
- Dennis Tye - UI, InputValidation and VerifyEmail class
- Kenneth Doan - UI, SendEmail class
2.	Title of project: Enneagram Quiz
3.	Purpose of Project
This project is an Enneagram test that allows users to select one of two choices depending on which statement they relate to the most. This program calculates the percent match the user is to each Enneagram type and provides the user with descriptions of each enneagram type. By taking the enneagram test, the user will know their enneagram based on the highest percentage they score for one or more enneagram types.

Usage Notes:

Project Description: This project includes 6 .java files

1) enneagramTest.java: This code is the part of the program that allows users to take the Enneagram Test, where they will select one of two choices depending on which statement they relate to the most. This program calculatesthe percent match the user is to each Enneagram type and provides the user with descriptions of each enneagram type.

2) typeAnswers.java: This class holds all the questions used in the Enneagram Test class

3) main.java: This main class allows the user to see the Enneagram Test GUI

4) SendEmail.java: This class sends the user's result to their email that they input in the text box.

5) VerifyEmail.java: This class verifies if the email inputted by the user is a valid email.

6) InputValidation.java: This class validates the user's email if it is a real email address.

You must run this program on an IDE that can compile Java Code. We created this program with the Eclipse IDE, therefore, running the program on the same IDE or a similar one would be ideal.

To formulate the questions and Enneagram Test results we used this free RHETI Sampler as my key http://www.coralvilleumc.org/uploads/pdf/RHETI_SamplerHC.pdf
